MVC architecture: 
Laravel is an MVC-based PHP framework that ensures a tight separation between presentation 
layers and business logic. MVC stands for Model, View, and Controller. It is a design pattern
 that separates the model (logic, data handling), view (UI), and controller processes
  (interface).

    -> Model:
    Deals wih Database, It interacts with the database.

    -> View:
    User interface and interaction part

    ->controller
    Controls and contains all the logics.

    writing very simple.
